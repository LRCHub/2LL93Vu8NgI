[00:05.89] I know you think that I shouldn't still love you or tell you that
[00:15.67] But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
[00:22.15] Where's the sense in that?
[00:35.15] 
[00:26.88] I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
[00:33.24] Or return to where we were
[00:46.24] 
[00:38.92] But I will go down with this ship
[00:44.32] And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[00:48.78] There will be no white flag above my door
[00:54.37] I'm in love and always will be
[01:09.37] 
[01:04.14] I know I left too much mess and destruction to come back again
[01:13.96] And I caused nothing but trouble
[01:17.25] I understand if you can't talk to me again
[01:38.25] 
[01:26.44] And if you live by the rules of it's over
[01:31.10] Then I'm sure that that makes sense
[01:48.60] 
[01:37.56] But I will go down with this ship
[01:42.31] And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[01:47.17] There will be no white flag above my door
[01:52.93] I'm in love and always will be
[02:07.93] 
[01:59.08] And when we meet
[02:01.11] Which I'm sure we will
[02:03.74] All that was then
[02:07.02] Will be there still
[02:09.91] I'll let it pass
[02:12.67] And hold my tongue
[02:15.66] And you will think
[02:18.15] That I've moved on
[02:27.15] 
[02:22.41] I will go down with this ship
[02:26.57] And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[02:32.02] There will be no white flag above my door
[02:37.69] I'm in love and always will be
[02:52.69] 
[02:45.03] I will go down with this ship
[02:49.52] And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[02:54.87] There will be no white flag above my door
[03:01.19] I'm in love and always will be
[03:16.19] 
[03:08.20] I will go down with this ship
[03:10.61] And I won't put my hands up and surrender
[03:11.02] There will be no white flag above my door
[03:11.42] I'm in love and always will be
